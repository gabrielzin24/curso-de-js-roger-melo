/*
03 - To make sure that this file is really linked, display the phrase
"JS is Awesome!" in a browser alert.

As I mentioned during the class: don't worry about understanding 100% what the commands
"alert" and "console" do. We'll talk about them later =)

Use the spaces between the comments below to run the codes from the
Exercises. Including the alert mentioned above.
*/



/*
04 - Comment the alert you wrote above, using the one-line comment.
*/

/*
05 - Declare a const "myBirthYear", which receives the year of your birth, with 4
digits. For example: 1930.
*/



/*
06 - Declare a "currentYear" const, which receives the current year, with 4 digits.  
*/


/*
07 - Display the const "myBirthYear" and "currentYear", side by side, in the browser console.
*/



/*
08 - Give it a try.

- Declare a const "myAge", which receives the current year subtracted by the year of your
birth. But without typing the numbers manually.

You can use the minus sign (-) between the two values ​​and check what
it happens.

- Display "myAge" in the console.
*/



/*
09 - Before the console.log below, declare a const "ten", which receives the number
10 and:

- Uncomment the console.log;
- Replace the word "valor1" with the current year plus 10;
- Replace the word "valor2" with your age plus 10;
- Numbers must not be entered manually;
- Observe the result in the browser console.

Don't be scared by the crases and dollar signs. We'll talk more about operations
math and strings (texts) coming soon =)
*/

// console.log(`Em ${valor1}, will be ${valor2} years.`)
